      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This project is a part of the ongoing research on packed bed systems for cryogenic energy recovery. 
        The main objective of this project was to seamlessly log the temperature, pressure and mass flow rate data connected to different serial ports 
        of a desktop. Real time visulaization and monitoring of temperature within the packed bed, pressure and mass flow rate readings 
        enable better control, troubleshooting on the go.  Arising from this necessity was the customized VICER tool.

        <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>Built on the tkinter library, VICER provides a user friendly interface for real time monitoring and analysis of cryogeenic packed bed systems. 
      Within one click of a button, the user can start logging the data from multiple serial ports and save them in a single ordered csv file. 
      The data can be visualized in real time using a custom made plotting tool. Further, the temperature data within the packed bed is color coded to indicate the thermocline 
      evolution inside the bed.  It also is tailored to log data from lakeshore temperature controllers which are highly specialized equipment commonly used 
      in cryogenic experiments.  </p>
