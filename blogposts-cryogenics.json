    "content": "<p>Right, so the last blog, we have left you with a fe questions to think over- like why to even study cryogenics. Is there any benefite to mankind. So, let stry to uncover these inquisitive wraps in this post. <br/> To uncover these lets start with what we are familiar with. Lets say i gave you a cup of hot coffee and you feel its pretty hot. What would you do to make it colder -- (1) You would turn on the fan and let the air flow rapidly and take away the heat. However, you find that its taking longer times to cool down this way and you have a meeting to attend to , what would you do (ii) may be take a few icecubes from your refrigerator and kep it around the cup. There you have it, you managed to cool down your coffee to your desired comfort levels.    See what you have done there -- you have used a coolant - air or cold water or ice to cool down something. By cooling down something, you were able to achieve something (in your case, getting a good coffee). Now what if i tell you, simialrlioy there are some things that will happen to some substances, when you cool them down so low. Even below the temperature of ice, even below the lowest temperature naturally occurring on earth. Materails that we know as stable at room temperatuire suddenly act wierdly at those temperatures. A popular example will be of electrical conductivity. You all know, that we use copper wires in our homes for electrical conduction and we have learned that each wire has its own ressitance which eseentiallyu is a barrier to the flow of current, right. So, heres the deal, if you cooled some materials (not copper but other specail materials) to very low temperature, they give you no ressitacne. Which means you can transfer energy without any losses. For industires, this is a boon becasue their rehcnology, processes become efficient and inturn give monetary benfits. So, how do we reach that low temperature then. Well just like how you used a medium, such as a gas (air) , liquid(water) or a solid(ice) to cool donw your coffee, you use a medium to reach those low temperatures. The only difference is you have to reach way colder temperatures below zero (ice temperatire). The special properties that i talk can occur at temperatures even below the naturally ocurring temperatures on earth. Now the important question - It is easy to cool down coffee since we had water or ice easily (essentially a cooling medium or a low temperature source which allowed you to cool down your material, i.e, coffee) at our disposal.  Then how can anyone reach such low temperatures ?  The answer to this question is fundamental to the existence of cryogenic engineering: How to produce such cold temperatures (design of systems and processes than enable this) and how to operate equipmenta at these cold temperatures. We will come to this answer later in much detail in later blogs, but for now, I will give a very rudimentary understadning. We go back to the cooling coffee example. Think about how you were able to turn water into ice. You should have used a refrigerator that cooled your water down to a point where it turned into ice. Now, see, the refrigerator should have done something to achive 0 degrees celcius to form ice. It would have done some processes intenrally to reach that temperature. That is what we call a thermodynamic process. Similarily, to reach even colder temeprature you do these thermodynamic processes (may be of different type) to utlimately reach those colder temperatures. Now, depending on what you are cooling , just like how you converted water to ice at 0 degrees, you can convert say, a gas into a liquid, or a liquid into a solid at much lower temperatures.  Now that you have known atleast at a surface level how cold temperatures are reached and why do we need those cold temepratures, let us look into a few more areas where low temperatures are required in various sectors of our life. (1) We have alterady seen how superconductivity works. Lets assume that we have replaced all our elctrical lines with supercodncutring cables, we would get good quality and reliable energy, no voltage fluctuations, and possibly at a cheaper price.  Another important use of this supecondictivity is in the MRI scanners which take clear images of your internal body organs. Thanks to the technology of low temperaure production, MRI technology exists. (2) Food sector: another popular exmaple of low temperatures is freeze drying, food processing. Qucik freezing usually helps our food products to last longer without losing their nutritional benfits. Ever wondered how food such as exotic fruits, and meat not typically produced locally are still avaialble in nearby restaurants. (3)Pharma sector:  Cooling down vaccines to enable a process called lyophyilization which helps to presereve vaccines and pharma products. Remeber those times, when the covid vaccines were supposeldy costly because of the low temperature conditions required to mantian their effectiveness. (4) Space applications: A lot of electronic systems used in imaging satellite such as the space telescopes emit heat as they work. This heat has to be quickly removed, or else the chip will get fried. Low temperatures help to maintain the chips in working conditions.</p> </p> Until now, we have seen most the applications which people do not even assocaite cryogenics with. And most of these applications use cryogenics to cool down their processes, equipment etc. However, there are some more interersting use cases and applications of the low temperatures which we will see in the next blog. </p>"

        "<p>Every time I tried explaining what cryogenics meant to a layman I ended up failing. All one could associate it with is ISRO and rocket engines. It makes sense because these are what we generally see in the news and often talked about. Of course, people have heard the word Cryogenics but do not know what it actually is. Here I am, to make this explanation easy, interesting and fun for you. So, grab a coffee and relax, as we lift off to explore the world of cryogenics.<br/>If you open any textbook on cryogenics, you’ll find it defined as the branch of science and engineering that deals with processes occurring at <strong>very low temperatures</strong>. The word itself comes from two parts: <em>\"cryo\"</em> meaning <em>cold</em>, and <em>\"genics\"</em> meaning <em>production</em>. So, at its core, <strong>cryogenics is the science of producing and dealing with very low temperatures</strong>.<br/> But what does that really mean? Cryogenics as a field is quite broad. It looks at:<br/> 1. How to create very low temperatures (the science of cooling things down),<br />2. How to design systems that operate at these temperatures, which is where engineers like me and applied physicists come in,<br />3. How known physical processes behave when taken to these extremes, often revealing strange and fascinating behavior at the atomic or quantum scale—the kind of stuff physicists love to explore.<br/><br/> So you see, cryogenics isn’t just about one type of science or engineering. It’s a blend of mechanical, chemical, electrical, and physical sciences. It’s a truly interdisciplinary field.<br/><br/> Now, when we say “very low temperatures,” it’s natural to wonder: <br/> 1. Why do we even care about such low temperatures?<br/>2. What makes them so interesting to study?<br />3. How cold is \"cold\" in this context, exactly?<br />4. And more importantly, does any of this affect me in daily life?<br/>Great questions—and we’ll dive into all of them in the next post. For now, just remember: <strong>cryogenics isn’t just cold science—it’s a cool one too.</strong></p>"
