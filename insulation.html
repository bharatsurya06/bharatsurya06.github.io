      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>In cryogenic systems, preventing heat inleak from the surroundings is 
        essential because even small heat gains can cause the cryogen to warm up and evaporate, 
        leading to product loss, pressure buildup, and reduced storage efficiency. 
        Minimizing this parasitic heat transfer therefore helps maintain low temperatures, 
        improves safety, and reduces operating costs.

        To limit this heat inleak, multilayer insulation (MLI) is commonly used. 
        It is placed in the annular space between the inner and outer walls of cryogenic equipment such as
         storage tanks and transfer lines. MLI consists of alternating layers of reflective and spacer materials,
          typically maintained under vacuum. This arrangement suppresses radiation, conduction, and convection, 
          thereby reducing the rate at which heat enters the cryogenic system.

          A MLI system is charecterized by its effective thermal conductivity, which is a measure of its ability to 
          resist heat transfer. The effective thermal conductivity represents the combined effect of all these mechanisms as a single equivalent property, allowing the insulation to be treated like a homogeneous material for analysis and design.

          This parameter is important because it provides a practical way to compare different MLI configurations, l
          ayer densities, and vacuum conditions. A lower effective thermal conductivity indicates better insulation 
          performance, meaning less heat inleak and lower cryogen losses. 
          Therefore, evaluating and selecting MLI based on its effective thermal conductivity helps 
          engineers choose insulation systems that ensure efficient, safe, and economical operation of cryogenic equipment.

      <p> The effective thermal conductivity of MLI is strongly influenced by several interacting factors, 
        including the properties of the reflector and spacer materials, layer density and thickness, and the
         level of vacuum. Because heat transfer in MLI occurs through multiple coupled mechanisms, developing 
         analytical expressions that accurately capture the influence of all these parameters is highly complex a
         nd often impractical.

        Although experimental measurements can provide reliable values of effective thermal conductivity, 
        conducting such tests for every new material combination or operating condition is time-consuming, 
        expensive, and technically demanding. Existing analytical and semi-empirical models attempt to estimate 
        this property, but most are limited in their ability to incorporate the full range of influencing variables 
        simultaneously.

        To address these limitations, this work employs an artificial neural network (ANN) to 
        predict the effective thermal conductivity of MLI.Machine learning provides a data-driven way to learn how 
        different parameters interact, even when the relationships are complex and nonlinear. This allows us to obtain
         quick and reasonably accurate predictions without performing numerous experiments or relying on 
         overly simplified theoretical models.
