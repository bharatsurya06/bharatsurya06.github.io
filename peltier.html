    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>      <p class="lede"> Thermocletric effect is a phenomenon where a voltage is generated across the a semiconductor junction when a temperature difference is applied. 
      The corrollary of this effect, known as the peltier effect is used to cool electronic components by applying a voltage across the junction. 
       These peltier devices are simple to operate, compact and contain no moving parts  which make them ideal choices for portable cooling applications. 
       
       In this project, a working prototype of a thermoclectic cooler were developed and demonstrated. This device operated on a 12 V power supply and was able to 
       cool down a small volume of container to temperatures below ambinet temperature. </p>
