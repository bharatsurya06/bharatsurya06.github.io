    "content": "<p>This was that el-classico that fit the billing. 
    Remeber those days of Mourinho and the subseqnet era of Messi and Ronaldo,
    when the whole footballing world was hyped up for the match. 
    We had those classic taunts by Mourinho in the press, 
    we had four players tacking Messi and leading to something not less than a world war. 
    Well, this hype went down when ronaldo left real madrid. Although the rivalry existed, 
    it wasnt the same atlesat for me, who watches these matches from India, completley oblivious to the larger history of this rivalry. Well, the pre-game lead up reminded me of that rivalry, however, this time it was more political.  
    For anyone who is under a rock, the fiasco involved - the madrid media accusing to be copa del rey final referee favouring barcelona, followed by the referee breaking down due to this harassment in the pre-game presser. 
    Come match day, poor guy had to deal with a last minute penalty review which he initially awared to barca and eventually ws overturned. 
    I mean,  you had to look at Rudiger at the last minute of extra time when foul was called Mbappe when he was on the attack. Rudiger was literlly throing objects onto the referee. All this may sound so bad when you look at the game of football, but isnt this what el-classico used to promise. 
    Maybe I would have liked it if the referees werent lured into this, this drama would have been much more fulfilling if there was some potshots between the players. As i write down, i think the players due to their crammed calendars are protected from outsied noise these days, that they barely get anytime to 
    respond. Any statement would only lead to a lot of social media scrutinty and hate from own fan bases. But that is a separate conversation. 
     As far as the match was concerned, it was a classic. I missed the first 40 minutes as i dozed off to sleep, thanks to my pixel's alarm which didnt buzz. Barce were leading 1-0 by the time I startedd watching. I felt that this score was pretty dangerous 
     against Real Madrid to go into the half time and it was. I thought that a quick gaol at the start of second half would have killed things off but thanks to rapinha and his poor fininshing, Madrid was able to come back into the game. I personally feel taht Rapinha hasnt been the same after the international break, Sure he had a huge role to play in the crucial win against Celta Vigo, but he had a very off game. He needs to be more clinicnal if we want that european glory. 
     Coming back, I think Ferran Torres and Jules Kounde were the MOTM. Not just because they scored the crucialgoals but the holdup play of Ferran Torres I thought was good and defensively kounde played a huge role in the second half and especially in the extra time with crucial interceptions. More than Lounde's finish for the winner, His anticipation for that half ball was 
     what made the goal. We won and thats great but if I were to see one area where we have to find some solution is the left back positon. Gerard MArtin had a very poor game giving away balls in his own half which led to multiple chances for Real Madrid. I think Fort or even Eric garcia should start there in champions league espically with the 3-5-2 that Inter Milan plays. 
      This is the 27th Copa del rey title for barca and the first of treble set that we are looking for. ALright, congratutions Culers, we deserve this. Visca el Barca.
