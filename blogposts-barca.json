    "content": "<p> Barca will be coming into the match with high spirits after their win against real madrid in the  copa del rey final. There has been much talk on fatigue since they will be playing within 3 days after the cup final. Whilst its true that we will be seeing some tiring legs in the second half of the game, I think the cup win would have pushed their spirits to do something special for the remainder of the season starting from the UCL semifinal. So, in this moment, I guess its more about the mental aspect than the physical. Moreover, its time of the season, where you dont have to play good football to win but need to manage the games and be clinical. Barca will be hoping for dominating the first half and take a comfortable lead before they try to manage the game. Now, a lot hinges of how fresh pedri is and how, he along with frenkie would navigate the crowded midfield of inter milan. I expect fermin lopez to be in the lineup in place of olmo to make spaces for rapinha and ferran whilst also providing a constant attackign threat though his deep runs. So, I think we will  see a lot of long balls from martinez and cubarsi and deep runs from rapinha and fermin lopez. And, of course, there is Lamine Yamal. While he is doing great for a 17 year old, I hope that he shows a little more calmness and play simple football instead of showboating when there is an oppurtunity to seal the game.  Lewandowski will be a huge miss in this game becasue of his linkup play and shielding the defenders. I hope ferran steps up just like he did against Real Madrid.  Defensively, the only area for concern is the left back area, where reports suggest that Gerard Martin is going to start. While he did not have a terrible game against Madrid, I feel the weakness is more on the offensive than the defensive side. I feel the absence of an attacking threat from MArtin is isloating rapinha to do all the work offensively on that wing, which is why we also see rapinha reduced threat in the games. The only thing i expect of Martin is to not mess up the offside trap which we have been doing so well in the recent times.   </p> <p> On the other hand, Inter Milan enter this game with a string of defeats to Milan in the cup final followed by defeats to Roma in the league. This meant that Napoli overtook them as league leaders and is likely to win the league. But, I think Barca should not read too much into this. Sure It raises doubts whether Inter can cope up, but common, these are professional players and at the end of the day, playing Barcelona is enough motivation. As they say, every goalkeeper turns into prime Buffon when they play Barcelona. Such is the case for any player. Inter will focus on their strenghts which is their low block midfield and effective counterattacks intiiated by their very able and technically rounded midfield with Lautaro Martinez upfront in attack. Lautaro Martinex is one the best shielders of the long ball in my opinion. Their two striker combination is surely going to cause problems for Barcelona. We have seen how the two forward approach of Mbappe and Vinicius troubled Barcelona in the second half of the cup final. So, If cubarsi and martinex step up and anticipate and win those crucial 50-50 balls, I think Barca will be safe.</p> <p> Alright prediction time, I think the first half from Barca will be crucial. This would be game with a very few clear cut chances for Barce, should they should be clinical enough to put those half chances. So, I epxect a narrow 1-0 win or a 1-1 draw for Barcelona. I certainly know that the game will be decided in the second leg.  </p>"

    "content": "<p>This was that el-classico that fit the billing. Remeber those days of Mourinho and the subseqnet era of Messi and Ronaldo,when the whole footballing world was hyped up for the match. We had those classic taunts by Mourinho in the press, we had four players tacking Messi and leading to something not less than a world war. Well, this hype went down when ronaldo left real madrid. Although the rivalry existed, it wasnt the same atlesat for me, who watches these matches from India, completley oblivious to the larger history of this rivalry. Well, the pre-game lead up reminded me of that rivalry, however, this time it was more political.  For anyone who is under a rock, the fiasco involved - the madrid media accusing to be copa del rey final referee favouring barcelona, followed by the referee breaking down due to this harassment in the pre-game presser. Come match day, poor guy had to deal with a last minute penalty review which he initially awared to barca and eventually ws overturned. I mean,  you had to look at Rudiger at the last minute of extra time when foul was called Mbappe when he was on the attack. Rudiger was literlly throing objects onto the referee. All this may sound so bad when you look at the game of football, but isnt this what el-classico used to promise. Maybe I would have liked it if the referees werent lured into this, this drama would have been much more fulfilling if there was some potshots between the players. As i write down, i think the players due to their crammed calendars are protected from outsied noise these days, that they barely get anytime to respond. Any statement would only lead to a lot of social media scrutinty and hate from own fan bases. But that is a separate conversation. As far as the match was concerned, it was a classic. I missed the first 40 minutes as i dozed off to sleep, thanks to my pixel's alarm which didnt buzz. Barce were leading 1-0 by the time I startedd watching. I felt that this score was pretty dangerous against Real Madrid to go into the half time and it was. I thought that a quick gaol at the start of second half would have killed things off but thanks to rapinha and his poor fininshing, Madrid was able to come back into the game. I personally feel taht Rapinha hasnt been the same after the international break, Sure he had a huge role to play in the crucial win against Celta Vigo, but he had a very off game. He needs to be more clinicnal if we want that european glory. Coming back, I think Ferran Torres and Jules Kounde were the MOTM. Not just because they scored the crucialgoals but the holdup play of Ferran Torres I thought was good and defensively kounde played a huge role in the second half and especially in the extra time with crucial interceptions. More than Lounde's finish for the winner, His anticipation for that half ball was what made the goal. We won and thats great but if I were to see one area where we have to find some solution is the left back positon. Gerard MArtin had a very poor game giving away balls in his own half which led to multiple chances for Real Madrid. I think Fort or even Eric garcia should start there in champions league espically with the 3-5-2 that Inter Milan plays. This is the 32nd Copa del rey title for barca and the first of treble set that we are looking for. ALright, congratutions Culers, we deserve this. Visca el Barca. </p>"

    "content": "<p>I guess it was 2010 when i just finished my 8th grade is when I watched the FIFA World cup in a newly bought Videocon television at my home. I guess, randomly we were watching Argentina vs Mexico game late in the evening. That was my first ever football match I have ever watched or followed. There was this bearded man shouting from the touchlines for Argentina and a short man with long hair leading Argentina's attack. Of course, you may have guessed it, I am talking about El Diego Maradona and the G.O.A.T Lionel Messi. I see messi's name flash on the screen and i knew him from some previous newspaper articles. I think Argentina won that game and are now in the quarter finals of the world cup. I was thoeoughly impressed with the short guy and I proceeded to watch the next Argentina game with Germany. I still remeber Germany humilaited Argentina 4-0 but in between there was an offside goal disallowed for Argentina. Now, I didint knew what offside was and left scraching my head. Since I was not an avid follower of the sport, I was dissapointed Argentina lost and just carried on. But the genius of Messi was still in my head. Fast forward, i did not watch any of the remaining matches of the world cup. Cut to 2011, Barcelona apparently lift the Champions league and were all over the news. At that point of time, there was no coverage for Champions league in India, and even if there was, I think it was on ten Action channel , whihc was not avaialble fro our cable tv provider. So no football at all. Eventually the repeat telecasts were given on ten sports and I used to watch them to see if Messi is there in any of the games. Once  I knew he plays for Barcelona, I tried to check if any barcelona repeat game was on. funnily, I once misttok David dilva for Lionel Messi. Long story short, throught the Hindu newspaper and the sportstar magazines, I sort of understood how club football worked and eventually I started following barcelona's games in 2011-12 season. At this point, I was not watching any live football, but only the repeat telcasts or highlights to know the result. since the matches used ot happn midnight, the newapapers gave the results the day after the match. This was a time where we had no mobile phone and a computer with internet acess. As it went on, there were heratbreaks when Barca lost to Ac milan in UCL first leg and cleberations when we did the remontada with 4-0. Then there was this Bayern Munchen team which decimated Barca 7-0 in the semifinals. My introduction to football happened thourgh messi and the introducion to how football is played happened to FC Barcelona. The reason why i fell in love with this club was simple. What is the aim of football as a game: (i) Its a team game (ii) You score more goals than the opponent and you win (iii) and how do you score goals by carrying the ball and making passes if you alone cant carry. Thats it Fc Barelona perfectly fit into my idea of what football is. Once i was lured into it, there was no coming back, I watched the hell out of all the premiere league games which were telecasted by our cable provider. I enjpyed the times of OG Man united, Arsenal, Thiery Henrys comeback goal, Rooney's Bicycle, Suarez's breakout season, Chelses breaking Barca's heart in UCL and what not. Supporting this team is nothing short of a roller coaster. We had our high during th e2014-15 treble season. Messi made me love football, gave me a reason to watch the game staying up in the nights. When he left, I realzed Messi was jsut the best worn hole to another unknown galaxy. If the new galaxy looks great you dont wanna go back even if the worm holes closing. </p>"
